 Data Analyst Portfolio

## Overview
Welcome to my Data Analyst portfolio repository! This repository contains a collection of data analysis projects that I've completed to showcase my skills and experience as a data analyst. Each project explores different datasets and employs various analytical techniques to derive insights and make data-driven decisions.

## Projects
Below are the projects included in this repository:

### Project 1: Netflix Movie Duration Analysis
- **Description**: In this analysis, we explore trends in movie durations over time using the Netflix movie dataset. We address key questions about changes in movie lengths and factors influencing these trends.
- **Questions**:
  1. Are Movies Getting Shorter?
- **How to Use**: Follow the provided instructions in the notebook to explore the findings of this analysis.
- **Files**:
  - `netflix_data.csv`: Dataset containing Netflix movie and TV show information.
  - `InvestigatingNetflixMovies.ipynb`: Google Colab notebook for the analysis.
- **Dependencies**: Python 3.x, Pandas, Matplotlib.

## Project 2: NYC Schools Analysis
- **Description**: In this analysis, we investigate the performance of New York City (NYC) schools based on SAT scores. The analysis aims to identify the top-performing schools and explore factors such as math results and borough-level statistics.
- **Questions**:
  1. Which NYC schools have the best math results?
  2. What are the top 10 performing schools based on the combined SAT scores?
  3. Which single borough has the largest standard deviation in the combined SAT score?
- **How to Use**: Follow the provided instructions in the notebook to explore the findings of this analysis.
- **Files**:
  - `nyc_schools_data.csv`: Dataset containing SAT scores and school information for NYC schools.
  - `NYC_Schools_Analysis.ipynb`: Google Colab notebook for the analysis.
- **Dependencies**: Python 3.x, Pandas, Matplotlib.

### Project 3: Nobel Prize Winner Analysis

- **Description**: In this analysis, we delve into Nobel Prize winner data to identify patterns and trends. By answering a series of questions, we aim to uncover insights about the most commonly awarded gender and birth country, analyze the distribution of US-born winners across decades and categories, explore the proportion of female laureates over time, identify the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize and her category, and identify individuals or organizations who have won multiple Nobel Prizes.

- **Questions**:
  1. What is the most commonly awarded gender and birth country?
  2. Which decade had the highest ratio of US-born Nobel Prize winners to total winners in all categories?
  3. Which decade and Nobel Prize category combination had the highest proportion of female laureates?
  4. Who was the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize, and in what category?
  5. Which individuals or organizations have won more than one Nobel Prize throughout the years?
 
## Project 4: Exploring Crime Data

In this project, we delve into the crime data of Los Angeles, represented in the `crimes.csv` dataset, to uncover insights and patterns regarding criminal activities. By analyzing this dataset, we aim to address several questions related to crime frequencies, peak hours, locations, and victim demographics.

### Key Questions:

1. **Peak Crime Hour:** Which hour has the highest frequency of crimes?
2. **Peak Night Crime Location:** Which area has the largest frequency of night crimes (crimes committed between 10pm and 3:59am)?
3. **Victim Age Groups:** How many crimes were committed against victims in different age groups?

### Dataset:
- **File:** `crimes.csv`
- **Description:** Dataset containing information about various crimes, including timestamps, locations, and victim demographics.


- **How to Use**: Follow the provided instructions in the notebook to explore the findings of this analysis.
- **Files**:
  - `nobel_prize_data.csv`: Dataset containing Nobel Prize winner information.
  - `Nobel_Prize_Winner_Analysis.ipynb`: Google Colab notebook for the analysis.
- **Dependencies**: Python 3.x, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

# Data Analyst Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Analyst portfolio! This repository houses a collection of projects demonstrating my skills and experience in data analysis. Each project showcases my ability to extract insights from data, communicate findings effectively, and make data-driven decisions.

## Projects

### Project 1: Hypothesis Testing in World Cup Matches

- **Description**: Conducted a hypothesis test to determine whether the mean number of goals scored in women's international soccer matches is the same as men's, using FIFA World Cup match data since 2002-01-01. Assumed each match is fully independent.
- **Files**:
  - `women_results.csv`: Dataset containing results of official women's international football matches.
  - `men_results.csv`: Dataset containing results of official men's international football matches.
  - `Hypothesis_Testing_Soccer_Matches.ipynb`: Google Colab notebook for the analysis.
- **Key Skills**: Statistical hypothesis testing, data manipulation.

### Project 2: NYC Schools Analysis

- **Description**: Analyzed the performance of New York City (NYC) schools based on SAT scores. Identified top-performing schools and explored factors influencing performance.
- **Files**:
  - `nyc_schools_data.csv`: Dataset containing SAT scores and school information for NYC schools.
  - `NYC_Schools_Analysis.ipynb`: Google Colab notebook for the analysis.
- **Key Skills**: Data manipulation, statistical analysis, data visualization.

### Project 3: Nobel Prize Winner Analysis

- **Description**: Delved into Nobel Prize winner data to identify patterns and trends. Explored gender distribution, geographical trends, and other factors influencing Nobel Prize awards.
- **Files**:
  - `nobel_prize_data.csv`: Dataset containing Nobel Prize winner information.
  - `Nobel_Prize_Winner_Analysis.ipynb`: Google Colab notebook for the analysis.
- **Key Skills**: Exploratory data analysis, statistical analysis, storytelling with data.

### Project 4: Exploring Crime Data

- **Description**: Analyzed crime data of Los Angeles to uncover insights and patterns in criminal activities. Investigated peak crime hours, crime locations, and victim demographics.
- **Files**:
  - `crime_data.csv`: Dataset containing crime data of Los Angeles.
  - `Crime_Data_Analysis.ipynb`: Google Colab notebook for the analysis.
- **Key Skills**: Data preprocessing, time series analysis, spatial analysis.

- **Note**: The raw crime dataset (`crime_data.csv`) used for Project 4 analysis was too large to upload to GitHub, but it is utilized within the notebook for analysis purposes. To access the raw data, please refer to the original source provided by the Los Angeles Open Data portal.

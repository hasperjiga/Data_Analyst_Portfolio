        "\n",
        "Welcome to the Nobel Prize Winner Analysis project! The Nobel Prize has been one of the most esteemed international awards since its inception in 1901. Each year, laureates are recognized for their outstanding contributions in various fields including chemistry, literature, physics, physiology or medicine, economics, and peace. Apart from the honor and substantial prize money, recipients are awarded a prestigious gold medal featuring the image of Alfred Nobel (1833 - 1896), the founder of the prize.\n",
        "\n",
        "For this project, we'll be exploring a dataset containing information about all Nobel Prize winners from 1901 to 2023. The dataset, sourced from the Nobel Prize API, is available in the `nobel.csv` file located in the `data` folder.\n",
        "\n",
        "Throughout this analysis, we'll delve into several questions related to the Nobel Prize winners' data. We encourage you to explore additional questions that pique your interest!\n"
